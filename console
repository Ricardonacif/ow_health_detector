1. capture the region of the screen with the health
2. use cv2.AdaptiveThreshold to get a binary image where the numbers are white and everything else is black
3. use connectedComponents to extract each digit (and discard components that are the wrong size)
4. iterate through each digit comparing it to templateds for the digits 0-9, and finding hte best match (also have a maximum threshold it must fall under)
5. combine digit classifications to get the full number(editado)
